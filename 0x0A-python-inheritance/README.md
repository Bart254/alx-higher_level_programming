Inheritance in Python
Python's inheritance is where a class(Derived class) acquires the attributes and methods of another class(Base Class).
This is a vital concept in OOP that will reduce your development time by preventing code duplication.
The exercises entailed cover the following scopes:
--- How to create subclasses
--- Multiple inheritance
--- When and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super.
As always, happy coding. Remember, good things take time.
