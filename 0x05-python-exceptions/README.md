A folder that contains projects on exceptions. Exceptions are errors that occur at runtime. These errors can be statically or dynamic managed. For the former, the program terminates with an error message while in the latter, the programmer determines the action of the program when the error is encountered: the err message to give, whether to terminate or not and the exit status to terminate with. We can therefore make a program more meaningful when we handle exceptions ourselves. Concepts in the folder include:
i) How to handle exceptions using try/except
ii) Raising exceptions
ii) Allocating a display instruction to an exception
Happy coding :-)
