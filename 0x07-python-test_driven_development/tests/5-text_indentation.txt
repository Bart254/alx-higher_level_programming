Function searches for specific letters then adds newline spaces
Let's set up the function

>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.append('..')
>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

if the function encounters ? . or :, it prints out the sentence with two new lines at the end
There should not be any spaces after and before the printed sentence

>>> text_indentation("One who would rather suffer an eternity of torment than beg for solace from the gods. Ning Que, what a man")
